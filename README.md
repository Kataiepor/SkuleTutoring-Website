I built a comprehensive website for a tutoring business using HTML, JavaScript, and CSS, making 42 courses accessible to students. The site features a clean, user-friendly design with intuitive navigation, allowing users to explore available courses easily. I integrated interactive elements and ensured the site is responsive across all devices. Additionally, I programmed a contact feature using EmailJS, enabling users interested in the tutoring services to directly reach out to the tutor through the contact page, streamlining communication and enhancing user engagement.
